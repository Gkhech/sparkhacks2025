# InterviewDivers

InterviewDivers is an AI-powered interview coach designed to help users practice and improve their interview skills. It provides interactive sessions by asking questions via text-to-speech and accepting user responses through speech-to-text. After all questions are answered, the app offers feedback on the user's responses. We came up with this idea because we wanted to get better at behavioral interviews.
